# Data Structures

## Stack
LIFO(last in first out) stack is a linear data structure written in template C++ class.
Supported Operations: push, pop, top, and isEmpty

## Queue
FIFO(first in first out) queue is a linear data structure written in template C++ class.
Supported Operations: enqueue, dequeue, getFront, getSize and isEmpty.

## Binary Search Tree
BST is a binary tree (where each node has two childs and there are no link among siblings) where each left subtree contains only smaller valued nodes and each right subtree contains only higher valued nodes.
Supported Operations: insert, del(delete), deleteAll, find, findMaxValue, findMinValue, printAll(in order)

## Binary Heap
It is a min heap where each child has larger value than their parent. It is implemented using its array representation.
Supported Operations: insert, findMin, deleteMin, makeEmpty, isFull, isEmpty and buildHeap.

## HashTable
HashTable is a data structure which maps keys to indexes for sustaining O(1) find complexity for all elements.
